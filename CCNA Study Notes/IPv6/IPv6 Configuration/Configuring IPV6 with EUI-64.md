### Configuring IPv6 with EUI-64

**CCNA Exam Objective:** 2.1 (Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix)

**EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier)** is a method for a device to automatically generate its own unique 64-bit IPv6 interface ID (the host portion of the address) directly from its 48-bit MAC address. This allows for quick and unique address configuration without needing to manually assign the full 128-bit address.

| `ipv6 address [prefix] eui-64` | **Configures EUI-64.** You provide the 64-bit network prefix, and the router does the rest.                  |
| `show interfaces [name]`       | Displays the hardware MAC address of the interface, which you need to manually calculate the EUI-64 address. |
| `show ipv6 interface [brief]`  | Verifies the full IPv6 address after it has been generated by the EUI-64 process.                            |

### The EUI-64 Process: MAC to IPv6 üìù

The conversion from a 48-bit MAC address to a 64-bit interface ID is a simple, two-step process.

**Let's use a sample MAC Address:** `00C0.A1B2.C3D4`

#### **Step 1: Insert `FFFE`**
The router splits the 48-bit MAC address in half and inserts the 16-bit hexadecimal value **`FFFE`** right in the middle.

* **Original MAC:** `00C0.A1` | `B2.C3D4`
* **Insert FFFE:** `00C0.A1` + **`FFFE`** + `B2.C3D4`
* **Resulting 64-bit ID:** `00C0.A1FF.FEB2.C3D4`

#### **Step 2: Flip the 7th Bit**

This is the most important and often confusing step. The 7th bit of the address, known as the **Universal/Local (U/L) bit**, is inverted (flipped). This bit indicates whether the address is globally unique (from a manufacturer) or locally administered.

1.  **Isolate the first byte:** The first byte is `00` in hex.
2.  **Convert to binary:** `00` in hex is `00000000` in binary.
3.  **Identify the 7th bit:** `000000`**`0`**`0`. The 7th bit is a **`0`**.
4.  **Flip it:** Flipping the `0` to a **`1`** gives you `000000`**`1`**`0`.
5.  **Convert back to hex:** `0000` is `0`, and `0010` is `2`. So, `00` becomes **`02`**.

* **Final Interface ID:** `02C0.A1FF.FEB2.C3D4`

### Practical Configuration

To configure this on a router with the network prefix `2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64`, you would use the following command.

```cisco
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ! You tell the router the network part, and it does the math for the host part
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64 eui-64
