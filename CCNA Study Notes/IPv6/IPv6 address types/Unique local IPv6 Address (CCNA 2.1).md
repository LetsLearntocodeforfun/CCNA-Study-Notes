You can think of a Unique Local Address (ULA) as the IPv6 equivalent of a private IPv4 address (like 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.1.0/24); it's used for internal network communication and is not routable on the public internet.
### An Overview of Unique Local Addresses (ULA)

**CCNA Exam Objective:** 2.1 (Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix)

A **Unique Local Address (ULA)** is an IPv6 address intended only for local communications within a site or between a limited number of sites. They provide a stable, private address space for internal devices like servers and printers, regardless of whether the network changes its public internet connection.

### Key Characteristics of ULA

* **Private & Non-Routable:** ULAs are **not** meant to be routed on the public internet. Internet routers are configured to drop any traffic with a ULA source or destination.
* **Address Range:** ULAs are easily identifiable as they always fall within the **`FC00::/7`** address block. This means the first seven bits are always `1111110`. In practice, the eighth bit is set to `1`, making the effective prefix **`FD00::/8`**.
* **Globally Unique (Probably):** The `/8` prefix is followed by a **40-bit random Global ID**. This ID is generated by the organization and, while not guaranteed, is statistically very likely to be unique worldwide. This minimizes the chance of address conflicts if two organizations ever merge their networks.

### Structure of a Unique Local Address

| ULA Component | Bit Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prefix** | Bits 1-8 (`/8`) | Always begins with **`FD`** (`11111101`). |
| **Global ID** | Bits 9-48 | A **40-bit hexadecimal number** that should be randomly generated by the organization to ensure the prefix is unique. |
| **Subnet ID**| Bits 49-64 | The standard 16-bit field used for internal subnetting. |
| **Interface ID** | Bits 65-128 | The standard 64-bit host portion of the address. |

**Visual Breakdown:**

`[-- Prefix --] [---------- Global ID ----------] [-- Subnet ID --] [---------- Interface ID ----------]`
`FD` : `A1B2:C3D4:E5F6` : `0001` : `1111:2222:3333:4444`
