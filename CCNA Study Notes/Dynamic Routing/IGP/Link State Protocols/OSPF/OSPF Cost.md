###  OSPF Cost

OSPF uses a metric called **cost** to determine the best path to a destination. The path with the lowest total cost is always preferred. By default, this cost is automatically calculated based on the bandwidth of an interfaceâ€”the higher the bandwidth, the lower the cost.

---

### How Cost is Calculated ðŸ’°

The cost of sending traffic out an interface is determined by a simple formula:

`Cost = Reference Bandwidth / Interface Bandwidth`

* **Reference Bandwidth:** A global value on the router that defaults to **100 Mbps**.
* **Interface Bandwidth:** The configured bandwidth of the specific interface.

**The Problem with the Default:**
With a 100 Mbps reference, any interface faster than 100 Mbps will have a calculated cost of 1, because OSPF only uses whole numbers.

* **FastEthernet (100 Mbps):** `100 / 100 = 1`
* **GigabitEthernet (1,000 Mbps):** `100 / 1000 = 0.1` â†’ **Cost of 1**
* **10-GigabitEthernet (10,000 Mbps):** `100 / 10000 = 0.01` â†’ **Cost of 1**

This makes it impossible for OSPF to differentiate between modern high-speed links. The solution is to change the reference bandwidth to a value higher than your fastest link.

### Essential CLI Commands

You have two main ways to control OSPF cost: globally by adjusting the reference bandwidth, or manually on a per-interface basis.

#### **1. Adjusting the Reference Bandwidth (Global)**

This is the recommended method for ensuring accurate path selection across your entire network. This command must be configured **on all routers** in your OSPF domain to ensure consistent calculations.

* **Command:**
    ```cisco
    router ospf 1
     auto-cost reference-bandwidth [Mbps]
    ```

* **Example (For a 10 Gbps Network):**
    Set the reference bandwidth to 10,000 Mbps (or higher).
    ```cisco
    router ospf 1
     auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
    ```
    Now, a 1 Gbps link will have a cost of 10 (`10000/1000`), and a 10 Gbps link will have a cost of 1, allowing OSPF to make an intelligent choice.

#### **2. Setting Cost Manually (Per-Interface)**

If you need to influence a specific path for traffic engineering purposes, you can manually override the calculated cost directly on an interface. This value takes precedence over the automatic calculation.

* **Command:**
    ```cisco
    interface [interface_name]
     ip ospf cost [value]
    ```

* **Example:**
    To make OSPF strongly prefer a specific Gigabit link, you can manually set its cost to be very low.
    ```cisco
    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
     ip ospf cost 5
    ```

#### **Verification**

Use the following command to quickly see the calculated cost on any OSPF-enabled interface.

* **Command:**
    ```cisco
    show ip ospf interface [interface_name]
    ```
    *(Look for the "Cost:" line in the output.)*
